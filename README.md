# Evolution-Platformer

Originally a platformer game in Unity where two players would race towards the end of the map, avoiding enemies and obstacles on the way.
These players were controlled using accelerometers on FPGAs and was hosted online on AWS.

Later on after learning about evolutionary algorithms, I took the game and decided to try and make an evolutionary AI which could solve it.

Most of the Unity necessary files have been excluded, only keeping the audio and pictures that I used, and the scripts I wrote.
All code is in the [Game_Contents](./Game_Contents) folder, specifically the [Scripts](./Game_Contents/Scripts) folder.
Evolutionary algorithm related code in [Evolutionary](./Game_Contents/Scripts/Evolutionary) folder.
